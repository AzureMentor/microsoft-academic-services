# Language Similarity Package

Language Similarity Package is a package to understand document semantics. We put together  pre-trained models and concept-tagging algorithms as a software package that executes in the end userâ€™s environment. Our customers can also tag, compare, and rebuild concept hierarchies based on any private corpus.
