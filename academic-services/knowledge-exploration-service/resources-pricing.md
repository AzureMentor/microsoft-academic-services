> [!IMPORTANT]
> We will be publishing a new version of MAKES in early 2020.  This version will be a turn-key solution to host MAKES in your Azure subscription.  For users of [Project Academic Knowledge](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/academic-knowledge/), this MAKES version will mirror the schema and API methods supported by that project, enabling users to host their own un-throttled version of the API's.

Use the Azure estimator links above to model different use scenarios, e.g. use hour pricing to simulate only keeping instances online when needed.
