# About Microsoft Academic Knowledge Exploration Service

Microsoft Academic Knowledge Exploration Service provides interactive academic search and refinement of the Microsoft Academic Graph using pre-built Knowledge Exploration Service engines.

These same engines are what powers the [Microsoft Academic website](https://academic.microsoft.com/). 

See links below for details about how each different engine is leveraged by the Microsoft Academic website:
* [Semantic Interpretation engine](../reference/engines/semantic-interpretation-engine.md)
* [Entity engine](../reference/engines/entity-engine.md)
