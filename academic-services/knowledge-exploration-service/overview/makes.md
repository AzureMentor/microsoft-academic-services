# Overview of Microsoft Academic Knowledge Exploration Service

The [Microsoft Academic website](https://academic.microsoft.com/) is one of the premiere consumers of KES, and uses it to generate two different KES engines using the data in [Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)](/microsoft-academic/microsoft-academic-graph/overview/microsoft-academic-graph). These engines in turn power MAâ€™s interactive semantic search experience.
