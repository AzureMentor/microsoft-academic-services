# About Microsoft Academic Knowledge Exploration Service

Microsoft Academic Knowledge Exploration Service (MAKES) enables users to host  private instances of an interactive academic search API, powered by [Knowledge Exploration Service (KES) engines](/azure/cognitive-services/KES/gettingstarted). The engines are generated by the Microsoft Academic engineering team using entities in the [Microsoft Academic Graph](../graph/index.yml), and distributed by the MAKES distribution service.

## Interactive academic search

### Academic query suggestions



Microsoft Academic Knowledge Exploration Service enables self-hosted interactive search and refinement of entities in the [Microsoft Academic Graph](../graph/index.yml). To achieve this is through a distribution prusing pre-built Knowledge Exploration Service engines.

These same engines are what powers the [Microsoft Academic website](https://academic.microsoft.com/). 

See links below for details about how each different engine is leveraged by the Microsoft Academic website:
* [Semantic Interpretation engine](../reference/engines/semantic-interpretation-engine.md)
* [Entity engine](../reference/engines/entity-engine.md)

# About Knowledge Exploration Service

Knowledge Exploration Service (KES) offers a fast and effective way to add interactive search and refinement to applications. With KES, you can build a compressed index from structured data, author a grammar that interprets natural language queries, and provide interactive query formulation with auto-completion suggestions.

KES is available as a completely stand-alone project. For details and documentation please see [this website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/KES/overview).

For the sake of this document it’s important to understand that when a KES “engine” is referenced it refers to a combination of a [compressed binary index](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/KES/gettingstarted#build-a-compressed-binary-index) and a [compiled SRGS grammar](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/KES/gettingstarted#compile-the-grammar), which are required for KES to operate. 

Each engine's index conforms to a [specific schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/KES/schemaformat), which defines what attributes are available and the operations that can be used to query them.
